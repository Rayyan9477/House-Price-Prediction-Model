## Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model. The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. The dataset is uploaded by the user, and the model is trained to predict house prices based on various features.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values for numerical and categorical data.
- Feature Engineering: Preprocessing numerical and categorical data.
- Model Selection: Using RandomForestRegressor for prediction.
- Model Training: Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Model Evaluation: Calculating Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
- Visualization: Plotting actual vs predicted house prices.
