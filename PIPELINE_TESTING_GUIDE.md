# 🚀 Complete CI/CD Pipeline Testing Guide

## Current Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

All GitHub secrets have been configured and the initial code quality workflow has been triggered.

## 🔄 Complete Pipeline Flow

```
dev branch → Code Quality Check → test branch → Unit Testing → master branch → Docker Deploy + Email
```

## 📋 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Verify Code Quality Workflow ✅ 
**Status**: Currently running/completed
- Go to: https://github.com/Rayyan9477/House-Price-Prediction-Model/actions
- Check that "Code Quality Check" workflow passed

### Step 2: Create Pull Request to Test Branch
```bash
# This will trigger the Testing Workflow
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Create Pull Request: dev → test
3. Wait for tests to complete
4. Merge the PR (requires admin approval)
```

### Step 3: Create Pull Request to Master Branch  
```bash
# This will trigger the Deployment Workflow
1. Create Pull Request: test → master  
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check your email: i222489@nu.edu.pk
4. Verify Docker image: rayyan9477/house-price-prediction
```

## 🔍 What Each Workflow Does

### Code Quality Workflow (dev branch)
- ✅ Python syntax validation
- ✅ flake8 PEP 8 compliance
- ✅ Security scanning with bandit
- ✅ Code complexity analysis

### Testing Workflow (test branch)  
- ✅ Unit test execution with pytest
- ✅ Code coverage reporting
- ✅ API endpoint validation
- ✅ Flask application startup testing

### Deployment Workflow (master branch)
- ✅ Docker image build and optimization
- ✅ Push to Docker Hub (rayyan9477/house-price-prediction)
- ✅ Container security scanning
- ✅ Email notification to i222489@nu.edu.pk

## 📧 Email Notification Content

You will receive an email with:
- Repository: House-Price-Prediction-Model
- Branch: master
- Commit SHA and details
- Build Status: success/failure  
- Direct link to workflow logs
- Timestamp of deployment

## 🐳 Docker Image Access

After successful deployment:
```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull rayyan9477/house-price-prediction:latest

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 rayyan9477/house-price-prediction:latest

# Access the API
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

If everything works correctly:
1. ✅ Code quality checks pass
2. ✅ All unit tests pass
3. ✅ Docker image builds successfully  
4. ✅ Image pushes to Docker Hub
5. ✅ Email notification arrives at i222489@nu.edu.pk
6. ✅ API is accessible via Docker container

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If any step fails:
1. Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify all 4 GitHub secrets are correctly set
3. Ensure Docker Hub account rayyan9477 has access
4. Check email settings and Gmail app password
